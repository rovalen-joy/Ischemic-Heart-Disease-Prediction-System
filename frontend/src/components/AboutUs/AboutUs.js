              Itâ€™s important to understand that the IHD Prediction System is a tool designed to assist with predicting the risk of ischemic heart disease. However, it does <strong>not</strong> provide medical diagnoses or prescribe treatments. Any decisions about patient care, including diagnosis and treatment, should always be made by qualified medical professionals. Our system is here to support healthcare providers, but it cannot replace their expertise and judgment.
